Android Account Remover
===================

##Delete first account listed in sync settings

This is a small Android utility used to remove the first account in the sync settings. I wrote it for use in [an application I wrote to artificially inflate the number of installs on apps in the Google Play Store.](https://github.com/graves/playstorepy) I was suprised to see nothing like this existed and used it as an opportunity to brush up on my Java chops and diversify my body of work.
